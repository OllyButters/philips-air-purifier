# philips-air-purifier

Simple python script to get the air quality data from my Philips Air Purifier.

For reasons I don't understand the much more functional library at <https://github.com/rgerganov/py-air-control> doesn't seem to work with my device. So I wrote this simple script to get the data I need (with a few hints from the above library).

## My devices

| Bedroom      | Philips           | 192.168.1.48 |
